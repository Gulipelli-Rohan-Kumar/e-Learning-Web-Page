                of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching,
                training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the
                guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal
                or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or
                acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. </p>

                the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India's new education system.The new
                policy replaces the previous National Policy on Education, 1986.The policy is a comprehensive framework
                for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban
                India. The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2021.Shortly after the release of the
                policy, the government clarified that no one will be forced to study any particular language and that
                the medium of instruction will not be shifted from English to any regional language.The language policy
                in NEP is a broad guideline and advisory in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and
                schools to decide on the implementation.Education in India is a Concurrent List subject </p>
